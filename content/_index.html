date: ''
---



<p>With the emergence of new sensors and millions of GPS units produced each year, geographic data is becoming ubiquitous.
Transport is an inherently spatial activity, displacing people, goods and services between A and B.</p>
<p>ITS Leeds is ideally placed to lead research into rapidly evolving methods of geographic analysis applicable to a range of transport phenomena including road traffic safety, urban planning and optimal location of new transport investment.
The content on these pages aims to provide a taster of whatâ€™s possible and how a Geospatial theme could help put ITS Leeds not only on the map but <em>centre-stage</em> for modern transport geography.</p>
